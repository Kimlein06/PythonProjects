# Project Overview
=====================

# CLI

This project is about organizing your daily tasks into two categories: completed tasks and incomplete tasks. Here’s how it works:

1. At the start of the day, you create a checklist of tasks you want to accomplish.

2. At the end of the day, you review which tasks you could finish and which you couldn’t.

   – If a task is finished, you move it to the completed tasks list.

   – If a task is not finished, you move it to the incomplete tasks list.

This way, by the end of each day, you’ll have a clear overview of what you completed and what still needs attention.
